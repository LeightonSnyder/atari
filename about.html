				<h1>ABOUT THIS APP</h1>

            <section class="col-sm-12">
				<p>The app’s purpose is to encapsulate the Atari game collection and experience all into one app.
                    Each page captures the nostalgic experience of the Atari 2500.</p>

                <p>The first page contains the classic Atari logo and a scroll down library of games that are ordered from most popular to least and also includes a search bar to locate from a variety of over 400+ games. When you select a game from the library the classic Atari controller page comes up with the game that you selected. </p>

                <p>The color scheme is inspired by the original console and is mostly grey and red. There will be a border surrounding the game screen to emulate the old 80’s television screen style. On the top of the page will be an image of the game “cartridge” you selected, it will act as a button that you can click to change your game and jump back to the game library to select a new one. On the bottom left corner of the game page is a toggle button that change what type of controller you want based on personal preference. You can choose between an atari
    classic controller and the default controller.</p>

                <p>Our target audience is mostly aimed towards classic gamers who want to recapture the
nostalgic moments that come with the Atari experience such as popping in a new cartridge
flicking the on button and being able to readily play their game with no interruptions. This app
also makes it available to younger generations who have a curiosity on older generation
consoles and don’t have to purchase emulators or the original product.</p>
